The horizon has been bleeding scarlet 
The blue blank sky has turned violet
The sun is casting long shadows 
Cant tell if the trees are shrieking or screaming
the light is now gone, Twilight they call it
the wait for day is long, but it will be worth it
The orchestra of silence is the most melodious 
Night endures hope and gives strength to cope
The stars keep me company, I'm not alone
